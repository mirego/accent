**The first developer-oriented translation tool**. Accent’s engine coupled with the asynchronous flow between the translator and the developer is what makes Accent the most awesome tool of all.

The Accent API provides a powerful abstraction around the process of translating and maintaining the translations of an app.

* **Collaboration**. Centralize your discussions around translations.
* **History**. Full history control and actions rollback. _Who_ did _what_, _when_.
* **UI**. Simple yet powerful UI to enable translator and developer to be productive.
* **GraphQL**. The API that powers the UI is open and documented. It’s easy to build a plugin/cli/library around Accent.

## Requirements

- `erlang ~> 20.1`
- `elixir ~> 1.6.0`
- `postgres >= 9.4`
- `node.js >= 8.5.0`
- `libyaml >= 0.1.7`

## Executing mix commands

The app is modeled with the [_Twelve-Factor App_](https://12factor.net/) architecture, all configurations are stored in the environment.

When executing `mix` commands, you should always make sure that the required environment variables are present. You can `source`, use [nv](https://github.com/jcouture/nv) or a custom l33t bash script.

Every following steps assume you have this kind of system.

But Accent can be run with default environment variables if you have a PostgreSQL user named `postgres` listening on port `5432` on `localhost`.

### Example

With `nv` you inject the environment keys in the context with:

```
$ nv .env mix <mix command>
```

## Quickstart

1. If you don’t already have it, install `nodejs` with `brew install nodejs`
1. If you don’t already have it, install `elixir` with `brew install elixir`
2. If you don’t already have it, install `libyaml` with `brew install libyaml`
2. If you don’t already have it, install `postgres` with `brew install postgres` or the [macOS app](https://postgresapp.com/)
3. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get` and `npm --prefix webapp install`.
4. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
5. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
5. Start Ember server with `npm --prefix webapp run start`
6. That’s it!

## Environment variables

Accent provides a default value for every required environment variable. This means that with the right PostgreSQL setup, you can just run `mix phx.server`.

## Tests

### API

Accent provides a default value for every required environment variable. This means that with the right PostgreSQL setup (and a few setup commands), you can just run `mix test`.

```
$ npm --prefix webapp run build
$ mix run ./priv/repo/seeds.exs
$ mix test
```

## Deploy on Heroku

An Heroku-compatible `app.json` makes it easy to deploy the application on Heroku.
