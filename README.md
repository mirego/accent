[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mirego/accent/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mirego/accent?branch=master) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/mirego/accent](https://badges.gitter.im/mirego/accent.svg)](https://gitter.im/mirego/accent?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Accent provides a powerful abstraction around the process maintaining translations in a web/native app.

- **History**. Full history control and actions rollback. _Who_ did _what_, _when_.
- **UI**. Simple yet powerful UI to enable translator and developer to be productive.
- **CLI**. [Command line tool](https://github.com/mirego/accent-cli) to easily add Accent to your developer flow.
- **Collaboration**. Centralize your discussions around translations.
- **GraphQL**. The API that powers the UI is open and documented. It‚Äôs easy to build a plugin/cli/library around Accent.

## üöß Requirements

- `erlang ~> 21.2`
- `elixir ~> 1.8`
- `postgres >= 9.4`
- `node.js >= 8.5.0`
- `libyaml >= 0.1.7`

## üéõ Executing mix commands

The app is modeled with the [_Twelve-Factor App_](https://12factor.net/) architecture, all configurations are stored in the environment.

When executing `mix` commands, you should always make sure that the required environment variables are present. You can `source`, use [nv](https://github.com/jcouture/nv) or a custom l33t bash script.

Every following steps assume you have this kind of system.

But Accent can be run with default environment variables if you have a PostgreSQL user named `postgres` listening on port `5432` on `localhost`.

### Example

With `nv` you inject the environment keys in the context with:

```shell
$ nv .env mix <mix command>
```

## üèé Quickstart

_This is the full development setup. To simply run the app, see the *Docker* instructions_

1. If you don‚Äôt already have it, install `nodejs` with `brew install nodejs`
2. If you don‚Äôt already have it, install `elixir` with `brew install elixir`
3. If you don‚Äôt already have it, install `libyaml` with `brew install libyaml`
4. If you don‚Äôt already have it, install `postgres` with `brew install postgres` or the Docker setup as described below.
5. Install dependencies with `make dependencies`
6. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
7. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
8. Start Ember server with `npm run start --prefix webapp`

_That‚Äôs it!_

### Makefile

The Makefile should be the main entry for common tasks such as tests, linting, Docker, etc. This simplify the developpement process since you don‚Äôt have to search for which service provides which command. `mix`, `npm`, `prettier`, `docker`, `stylelint`, etc are all used in the Makefile.

### Docker

For the production setup, we use Docker to build an OTP release of the app. With docker-compose, you can run the image locally. Here are the steps to have a working app running locally with Docker:

_When running the production env, you need to provide a valid GOOGLE_API_CLIENT_ID in the `docker-compose.yml` file._

1. Run `make build` to build the OTP release with Docker
2. Run `make dev-start-postgresql` to start an instance of Postgresql. The instance will run on port 5432 with the `postgres` user. You can change those values in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Run `make dev-start-application` to start the app! The release hook of the release will execute migrations and seeds before starting the webserver on port 4000 (again you can change the settings in `docker-compose.yml`)

_That‚Äôs it! You now have a working Accent instance without installing Elixir or Node!_

## üå≥ Environment variables

Accent provides a default value for every required environment variable. This means that with the right PostgreSQL setup, you can just run `mix phx.server`.

## ‚úÖ Tests

### API

Accent provides a default value for every required environment variable. This means that with the right PostgreSQL setup (and a few setup commands), you can just run `mix test`.

```shell
$ npm --prefix webapp run build
$ mix run ./priv/repo/seeds.exs
$ mix test
```

The full check that runs in the CI environment can be executed with `./priv/scripts/ci-check.sh`.

## üöÄ Deploy on Heroku

An Heroku-compatible `app.json` makes it easy to deploy the application on Heroku.
