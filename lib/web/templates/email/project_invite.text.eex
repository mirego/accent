<%= @user.email %> has invited you to collaborate on the project "<%= @project.name %>".

If you already have an account (<%= @email %>), you can just login (<%= webapp_url() %>) and youâ€™ll see the project.

If not, creating an account is as simple as logging in with the invited Google account (<%= @email %>) on <%= webapp_url() %>
