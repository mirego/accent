## Why have a Code of Conduct?

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Accent effectively, productively, and respectfully, even in face of disagreements. The Code of Conduct also provides a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

## Our Values

These are the values Accent developers should aspire to:

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
  - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
- Be thoughtful
  - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
  - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
- Avoid destructive behavior
  - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

- Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
- Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
- Bullying or systematic harassment.
- Unwelcome sexual advances.
- Incitement to any of these.
